# experiment-1
## simple c++ codes.
## Aim - 
To write simple C++ programs that demonstrate basic operations such as 
printing a message, calculating the sum of numbers.

## Theory - 
These programs introduce fundamental concepts in C++ programming:
Hello World: Demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program and how to output text to the console.
Sum: Shows how to perform arithmetic operations and calculate the sum of numbers.

## Code - 
### 1. 
```
//subham
//23070123132
//entc b2
//experiment 1
#include<iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout<<"hello world";
    return 0;
}
```

### 2.
```
//subham
//23070123132
//entc b2
//experiment 1
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int num1,num2,num3,sum=0;
    cout<<"enter first number-";
    cin>>num1;
    cout<<"enter second number";
    cin>>num2;
    sum=num1+num2;
    cout<<"sum of given numbers="<<sum;
    return 0;
}
```

## output-
